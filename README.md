# crypto-blocklist
A twitter username list of people with eth / crypto / btc / nft in their username

If you have users to add, please submit a pull request deduped and submit a minimum of 100 users.

# info
This just uses the twitter api to pull all users using the built-in search function

Due to limitations to the API, only the first 1000 uers can be pulled related to the search, and the search is not exact to your query.

This means the file provided is pretty much as close as we can get without changing the search terms.
